Below the diagram, describe each step in detail:

## DDoS Attack Sequence Description

1. **Attacker Commands Bots**: The attacker sends a command to the compromised systems (bots) to initiate the flood of requests.
2. **Bots Send Requests**: The bots send multiple requests to the targeted web server, overwhelming it with traffic.
3. **Web Server Alerts Firewall**: The web server detects the high volume of traffic and alerts the firewall.
4. **Firewall Analyzes Traffic**: The firewall analyzes the incoming traffic to identify patterns indicative of a DDoS attack.
5. **Firewall Blocks IPs**: Based on the analysis, the firewall takes action to block suspicious IP addresses to mitigate the attack.
6. **Bots Continue Sending Requests**: Despite the firewall's efforts, the bots continue to send requests, leading to service denial.
7. **Web Server Denies Service**: As a result of the overwhelming requests, legitimate users are denied access to the web server.

### Conclusion
This sequence diagram illustrates the stages of a DDoS attack and the defensive responses from the network's firewall, highlighting the continuous struggle between attackers and defense mechanisms.
